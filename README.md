# 🌀 CP1404 – Coding My Way Out

**Welcome to the chaos.**  
This repo is where I dump all my progress, pain, breakthroughs, bugs, "wtf Python" moments, and occasional triumphs from **Programming II (CP1404)**.

No corporate fluff. Just me vs. Python.  
Semester: TR3 2025 @ JCU Singapore  
Educators: Cynthia Chan and Lindsay Ward
